## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

By engaging with this challenge, I was able to have an idea about developing Web forms with multiple steps. I used my previous JavaScript knowledge to develop this Web App by manipulating same knowledge in various ways.

### Continued development

I haven't done advanced form validations in this project. So, I intend to keep working on that.
